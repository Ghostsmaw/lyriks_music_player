# A Spotify 2.0 Clone Music App with React 18! (Tailwind, Shazam, Redux)

- I used React functional components and their reusability
- I used Redux Toolkit to manage the state of the application
- I used Tailwind to make the app responsive on all devices
- I fetch data from unlimited sources using RapidAPI.
